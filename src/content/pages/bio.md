## About Me

I’m PinHao, currently working at Academia Sinica, with a research focus on post-quantum cryptography.
I’m also interested in Ethereum and building cryptographic systems that are more efficient in practice.

### Process & Materials

Every piece is crafted in my home studio. I formulate my own glazes using locally sourced ash and minerals, resulting in surfaces that are unique to my environment. The firing process is a collaboration with the kiln; I can guide the heat, but the flame has the final say.

When I am not in the studio, you can find me hiking the trails of the Cascades or scouring the beach for interesting stones and driftwood.
